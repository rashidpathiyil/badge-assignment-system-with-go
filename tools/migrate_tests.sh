# migrate_tests.sh - Script to help migrate existing tests to the new structure
#
# Usage: ./tools/migrate_tests.sh
#
# This script will:
# 1. Create the new test directories if they don't exist
# 2. Move API tests to the new integration test structure
# 3. Update import paths in the moved files
# 4. Create a backup of the original tests
