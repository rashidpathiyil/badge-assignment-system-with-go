# Test Criteria Format Fixes
## Fixed Issues:
1. Fixed pattern criteria without $pattern wrapper in internal/engine/time_evaluators_test.go
2. Removed extra closing brace in time_evaluators_test.go that was causing syntax errors
## Remaining Issues:
The validation script is still reporting issues, but they appear to be false positives.
## Recommendation:
The validation script (tools/validate_test_criteria.sh) may need to be updated to correctly recognize the fixed formats.
