# Legacy Tests

This directory contains legacy test files that were part of the original codebase.
These tests are kept for reference but are not part of the active test suite.

## Structure

- `api/`: Original API tests before refactoring to the new integration test structure

## Notes

When writing new tests, please follow the pattern in `tests/integration` rather than
using these legacy tests as examples.
