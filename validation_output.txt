==== Test Criteria Validation Report ====
Found 4 potential issues in test criteria formats.

Issue details:
  - pattern_test.go: float values without explicit type conversion
130:			"maxDeviation": float64(0.20), // Allow up to 20% deviation
178:			"minIncreasePct": float64(10.0), // At least 10% average increase
226:			"maxDecreasePct": float64(15.0), // Maximum 15% decrease per period (looking for gradual decline)
280:			"minIncreasePct": float64(5.0),
301:			"maxDeviation": float64(0.25), // Allow up to 25% deviation for weekly consistency
    ... and 6 more instances

  - pattern_test.go: pattern criteria without $pattern wrapper
223:			"pattern":        "decreasing", // Looking for decreasing pattern

  - rule_engine_test.go: potential inconsistent criteria nesting
26:		"criteria": map[string]interface{}{
96:		"criteria": map[string]interface{}{
111:		"criteria": map[string]interface{}{
244:		"criteria": map[string]interface{}{

  - time_evaluators_test.go: float values without explicit type conversion
92:			"maxDeviation": float64(0.1),

Recommendations:
1. Run the fix_test_criteria.sh script to address the identified issues
2. Manually review any remaining issues that couldn't be automatically fixed
3. Update the TEST_CRITERIA_EXAMPLES.md document with additional examples if needed

For reference, the correct criteria formats are documented in:
docs/TEST_CRITERIA_EXAMPLES.md
