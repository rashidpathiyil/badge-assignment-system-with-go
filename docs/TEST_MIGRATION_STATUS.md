# Test Migration Status

This document tracks the status of test migration in the badge assignment system.

## Completed Migrations

1. âœ… API Integration Tests
   - Legacy tests moved to `tests/legacy/api/`
   - New sample tests created in `tests/integration/`

2. âœ… Engine Tests
   - Legacy tests moved to `tests/legacy/engine/`
   - Created placeholder unit tests in appropriate packages:
     - `internal/engine/badge/badge_test.go`
     - `internal/engine/pattern_test.go`
   - Added integration test example in `tests/integration/engine_test.go`
   - Fixed pattern criteria test to properly pass

3. âœ… Test Structure
   - All tests now follow the new structure
   - Unit tests are placed alongside the code they test
   - Integration tests are organized in the `tests/integration/` directory
   - Test utilities are centralized in `internal/testutil/`

## Pending Implementation

The following tests have been migrated but need their implementations completed:

1. ðŸ”„ Badge Tests
   - `internal/engine/badge/badge_test.go` - Placeholder created, implementation needed
   - Should implement the tests from the legacy badge tests

2. ðŸ”„ Pattern Tests
   - `internal/engine/pattern_test.go` - Placeholder created, implementation needed
   - Should implement the tests from the legacy pattern criteria tests

## Migration Guidelines

When implementing the pending tests:

1. Follow the standard Go testing patterns
2. Use the `testify/assert` package for assertions
3. Implement table-driven tests where appropriate
4. Ensure all edge cases are covered
5. Reference the legacy tests for test logic and scenarios

## Verification

To verify the test migration is complete:

```bash
# Run all tests
make test-all

# Run specific test packages
go test ./internal/engine/... -v
go test ./tests/integration/... -v
```

All tests should pass with no linting errors.

## Recent Updates

- Fixed the `TestPatternCriteria` test by correcting the criteria format
- All tests are now either passing or properly skipped
- The test migration structure is complete and verified
